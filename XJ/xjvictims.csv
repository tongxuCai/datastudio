Usually, the first level county police have to start a multi-level reporting process by informing the city office first, and it would take time until the matter would finally reach the Xinjiang Autonomous Region government, which would confirm that the two workers pose no threat, and only then they would be released. Therefore, the matter is quite clear, as the decision making power rests with authorities in Xinjiang’s government, perhaps even with individuals on a national government level. Investigative bodies in higher government levels hold access to information, while the low-level units just carry out their policies. Our operational unit has done its best in providing documentation but is unable to act further, which leaves the following means available (if the local government requests them).<br />Besides Murat and Moral, there is Bazarbek, Toleu, Toqtarghazy and 3 others with whom we have lost contact a long time ago, concrete reasons unknown. Given the current standings, our operational unit has analysed the situation carefully and decided to act as follows:<br /><br />1. Increase awareness of such matters and follow the guidelines from all governmental levels concerning the workers’ management by refusing to act in ways contradictory to national policies.<br />2. Regarding those workers who are unable to return to their duty for a long time, we will increase efforts to act in accordance with Kazakhstan’s Labor Law by annulling their labour contracts (2 people have been relieved in such a way in the past month);<br />3. Prepare all operational marketing units to react to the company’s labour demand by organizing hiring processes for vacant positions. <br />4. As for the Kazakh engineers who are yet to be naturalized, we ask workers from all operational units to exercise caution and to act carefully on social media. They are advised not to publicly express any views which run contrary to national policies and not to participate in any activities which violate these policies, so as to prevent similar matters from occurring when returning to China.",35-55,M,Kazakh,Altay,---,---,---,---,engineer

Nazarbayev wasn’t strong enough to get him out, however, Mawlanimin added, before asking Erzhan about his family in China and eventually going to Erzhan’s two brothers’ work place and confiscating their phones. Erzhan’s phone was confiscated also.<br /><br />Erzhan’s passport expired during this time, but Mawlanimin told him that there was no chance for him to get a new one, and threatened to send him to camp if Erzhan came and asked again. This prompted Erzhan’s 80-year-old father to go see Mawlanimin, saying that he was ready to accept any punishment as he was old and didn’t care, but couldn’t stand seeing his son separated from his children. He also went to see the local Party committee secretary (____), who would tell Erzhan’s father that he was not aware of this and gave permission for a new passport to be issued.<br /><br />After getting his new passport, Erzhan went to Urumqi to submit the necessary documents to the passport-visa service center. The visa took 10 days, while the passport he would only get on January 31, 2019.<br /><br />Before returning to Kazakhstan, he decided to visit his sister-in-law in Shapshal County first, previously unable to do so for 2 years because of his ID being confiscated. At a checkpoint during the trip, he got off the bus to scan his ID – he mentions that only ethnic minorities had to get off the bus and go through these checks, not the Han. This resulted in the local police learning that he was going to Shapshal, which led to people from the security bureau following him and interrogating him for hours after he got to his sister-in-law’s house.<br /><br />They told him that his wife, Sagira Arystanbek (in Kazakhstan), was a Wahhabi, and that he could not go anywhere until this matter was properly investigated.

[G. A. Bunin: this is probably more reliable, having come from the victim himself.]<br /><br />Testimony 6: taking a picture with a Kazakh politician Bekbolat Tileuhan.","December 2018: Erbol was released on parole in October 2018, but still remains under surveillance. His health is not good, and he's receiving treatment at the hospital. He has to go to the police station to give a report daily.<br /><br />February 2019: Erbol has returned to Kazakhstan.","Unclear, possibly via WeChat.","Summary of Erbol's own testimony (Testimony 5):<br /><br />Erbol had been doing business in Xinjiang and would visit the Korgas ICBC regularly. On February 19, 2018, he was put into a camp after being accused of visiting Kazakhstan and having his parents there. He spent almost 8 months in the camp, before being released on October 8, 2018 and told that he’d be under house/village arrest for another 6 months. When needing to go to the county seat to resolve some matters, he’d first need to get a permit from the village administration. What was particularly inconvenient was that he had already sold his house in the village to buy one in the county seat, but could not actually live there because of the village arrest (he had not yet changed his registration). After four months, he was finally allowed to live at his home in the county seat, and was told that he would be allowed to go abroad.<br /><br />According to Erbol, IDs of those who were once in camp are programmed to beep whenever they go through a detector anywhere, prompting security to take the person’s photo (posing with the ID in their hand) and leading to all sorts of trouble/inconvenience.<br /><br />He was later told that he had been taken to camp because of contacting a criminal while in Kashgar, an Uyghur who was Erbol’s business partner. Erbol didn’t understand how he was supposed to know that someone had once been a criminal, as the Uyghur man was free and doing business, with nothing to prompt Erbol to be suspicious about him. The whole thing was just an excuse. The police also told him that they had prevented him from following a wrong path and becoming a criminal himself. However, it seems that the Uyghur man wasn't a former criminal at all, just a practicing Muslim.<br /><br />While in camp, Erbol was allowed to see his relatives once a month. There, they learned the Chinese language, Chinese law, and attended anti-religion propaganda lectures. It was easy for them as they were young and were not abused physically, but it was very hard for the older people, who couldn't learn Chinese and were punished as a result. Even an 80-year-old man was punished, according to Erbol, having one hand tied to the ceiling and forced to stand that way for hours. Erbol says that he wasn’t sentenced as he wasn't there on religious charges. Imams, however, could be sentenced to more than 20 years, and would be handcuffed and shackled 24/7. [Very possible that this was a kanshousuo and not a traditional camp, IMO, though the emphasis on Chinese-language study makes it hard to say. He also says that there were 5000 people in the facility, and that there were 4 such facilities in Zhaosu County alone, which seems like too big for a kanshousuo, and yet one wonders how Erbol would know these numbers. Also possible that a single facility had both “traditional camp” and kanshousuo units.]<br /><br />The camp was also hell for the elderly because some people couldn't control their need to urinate, and toilets could only be used during fixed times, and not whenever one needed. Some elderly people, having been unable to relieve themselves during the designated times, would potentially find themselves beaten for asking to use the toilet outside the fixed schedule.<br /><br />Outside the detention facilities, the people who are ""free"" cannot greet their elders with “essalamu eleykum”, which among Kazakhs is more traditional than religious.<br /><br />According to Erbol, asking for your passport resulted in the officials telling you that they would give it back in exchange for giving up all government subsidies/allowances and pensions.<br /><br />[According to Serikzhan Bilash,] Erbol made it back to Kazakhstan because of the international media's influence and the UN’s committee on human rights. When Erbol was once summoned by the county-level police, there was a representative from the Yining foreign affairs office, who told him that his case had gotten international attention, before telling him “to be good in Kazakhstan” because he (Erbol) would be a representative of China. Before that, it had been nearly impossible for him to meet even with the village head, as he would have to stand two hours in front of the village administration building in cold winter weather just to meet the village head to talk about his sister Dinara's case.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Testimony 6: Nurshat claims that she had to pay a total of 7000 Chinese Yuan (1040 USD) for Erbol’s and Dinara’s meals in re-education camp.

He is fluent in Mandarin.  Graduated from History faculty of Xinjiang University, he first worked as a teacher in a middle school. while working as history teacher, he organized many children events for after school activity. In early 1990s , he organized an art ensemble(senet omiki) called ""Arzu"" consists of  singers,comedian, dancers and actors  made public shows all around  ""Xinjiang"" that have Drama, songs, dance and comedy.  In mid 90s, he was invited and hired for Yili TV , at the same time he also opened up a school called "" Ili Yahs osmurlerni Terbiyelesh merkizi""(Ili childre-youth training center), which has wide range of after class courses like dancing,singing,boxing,language, science, journalism and announcer. (though boxing courses got canceled by govenrment). The school lasted until around 2013s and later incorporated with regional Government youth -children center called ""__________“ and he worked there as director_or similar position_ responsible for “ Uyghur part ”of the center. During this around 15-20 year history of school, they won many national even international awards in dancing and in other contests. The journalism course for kids continued ever year, making the trips all over Xinjiang and some developed cities of China , even made to Beijing in early 200s ,meeting with ""Ismayil ahat "" or ""seypidin eziz"" or someonelese.(forgot which one , but a very high position politician ).  After started to work in Ili TV, he named and directed a kids show called ""Hopeful eyes""(Umutluk Kozler) , which is still continuing if they they haven't cancel the program after he got arrested. He also directed few movies, kids songs, Musical dramas and documentaries  etc(for example, ""Qin Tomur Batur"", ""Sirlik Ongkur"", ""Rehimsiz Chush"", "" Tutunge aylanghan muhebbet"",etc ). <br /><br />He was listed as 10 best journalism workers of Yili by government in 2017.

After their investigation ended, I provided them some info about my father's past , But for the reason of his detainment, they put down something totally irrelevant from the info I provided about his past by saying its because of producing a program that detailed the financial struggles of three young student. The program was actually aired on TV and won some national and regional awards at that time. Even thought there were some problems before and after airing of the show, but its totally irrelevant and those kind of things are pretty ""normal "" things as he encountered many many times during his professional career.<br />The reason authorities used to arrest and sentence him is still unclear, that might be because he is journalist so they thought he knows a lot ,or might be me , as his son studying abroad or maybe some other reasons. but one thing I am pretty sure is that the show about three students has nothing to do with this. So in short, the ""reason "" part I think need to be corrected a little bit . And about his location I think very possibly he might be in Kunes Turme (____) .

Then the screen went black. This was in October 2017. Since then, the then 51-year-old has been detained. “We don’t know how he is doing,” says his wife, Gülnur Beikut, at our first meeting. She wears a blue dress; a simple gold necklace hangs around her neck. The interview with her and with all other family members of camp inmates has to take place at an unnamed location outside China. Anyone who talks to a foreigner in Xinjiang – or even just makes a call abroad – risks being arrested immediately and disappearing into a camp.<br /><br />Tursun is a member of the Chinese Communist Party who worked his way up from maths teacher to deputy director of city markets in Gulja, an administrative post. Like tens of thousands of ethnic Kazakhs, he moved to neighbouring Kazakhstan in 2011 after retiring – and because life there is cheaper. The family kept an apartment in Gulja. Last March he received a call from his previous employer who had questions about his pension. He should come to Xinjiang for two days to discuss them. “He thought it was just a formality,” his wife explains. But when he arrived in Gulja, authorities immediately took his passport. Officials accused him of having WhatsApp installed on his phone. Tursun had to spend 14 months in a in re-education camp. Since December he has been under de facto house arrest in Gulja. His family is hoping he will be allowed to return home.""",,,,,,,,,,35-55,M,Kazakh,Ili,house/town arrest,Jan. 2017 - Mar. 2017,contact with outside world,has problems,government

Two daughters and a son - Baythan Tursynbek (born in 2001), Aqerke Tursynbek (2006), and Aqedil Tursynbek(2011).<br /><br />Self-testimony from the victim (Testimony 13, summarized by G. A. Bunin):<br /><br />He went to his hometown in China on September 5, 2017, with the border staff taking away his passport and arranging for a car to take him to his hometown in Emin County (around 50 km away from the Bakhty border crossing). The next day, the local police told him not to visit them for the coming month unless there was an emergency. He didn't know what to do.<br /><br />After some time, he heard that his son in Kazakhstan injured his forehead and had to have an operation. Collecting all the necessary documents to prove it, he went to the police, but they wouldn’t return his passport, finding various excuses. They told him not to turn off his mobile phone and to be ready at any time to visit the station. He had to attend a flag-raising ceremony every Monday.<br /><br />In May, they called him to the police station. It was crowded and everybody was asked to fill in a form where they had to state their faith, if they were religious, and if they believed in the power of the Communist Party. The police warned that there’d be consequences if they wrote that they believed in God. In the end, Tursynbek wrote that he didn't believe in God.<br /><br />In June, they called him in again, saying that his children in Kazakhstan had filed a petition. Tursynbek told them that he wasn't aware of it. In fact, he didn't even have their contact info, having deleted them from his WeChat account. At the end of August, he was summoned again, with the police informing him that his passport was cancelled and that he had supposedly signed off on it himself, even though he had never signed such a document. <br /><br />On September 28, two guys from Homeland Security (___) came to meet him, taking him to a basement for an interrogation. It was nearly 20 meters underground, in a cell slightly larger than 10 square meters in area and with 6 barred cages in the cell, each smaller than one square meter. There were benches inside, but the cages were so tiny that you couldn't even lie down. Tursynbek would be questioned in a different room for three hours, in a tiger chair. The men, ethnic Kazakh police, asked him if he knew “Zharqyn 7”, or if he had ever listened to his lectures. Later, he was also asked about his relatives, including the deceased ones, as well as about his classmates, primary school teachers, and friends. They asked him to write a report about his current friends.<br /><br />While he was in the cage, he saw a Kazakh man who had worked as a teacher, named Ashel Token. Ashel was accused of talking to people in Kazakhstan over WeChat. <br /><br />Tursynbek would spend a total of 6 days there, having only rice and steamed buns. He says that it wasn't so hard to eat less, but that it was hard not to drink water. He was always thirsty.<br /><br />When they were about to release him, they made him say ""Long live Xi Jinping, long live the Communist Party"", and warned that he should make his family members stop petitioning.<br /><br />He then had to have a cadre as his “relative”, despite not even having his own house there. So he met up with his ""relative” on the street and they agreed to report that they lived together. The cadres needed to give their non-cadre ""relatives"" 30 RMB per night for their hospitality.<br /><br />Tursynbek’s hometown police would call him in regularly to fill in paperwork, later questioning him daily because he had informed his wife about his mother-in-law's (https://shahit.biz/eng/viewentry.php?entryno=278) detention and his brother-in-law's (https://shahit.biz/eng/viewentry.php?entryno=279) death. He even thought about divorcing his wife to be free of these interrogations.<br /><br />He was recruited to be a patrol guard in his village twice. There, they had to wear helmets, bulletproof vests, and hold a stick. They had to show up whenever the alarm rang in the shops or restaurants. The shop/cafe owners and workers also had to gather if an alarm rang. Each place had its own red button. Once, a drunk person pressed it, forcing everyone to show up ""armed"". They always told them to be on alert against the “evil forces”, though no one knew who they were. <br /><br />Tursynbek had two acquaintances who were religious and used to never drink, but both of whom do now. Women also have to drink. If you refuse, they say that it's a national beverage, and that you have evil thoughts and need to be cured. <br /><br />When he was called into the office to get his passport back, he saw 6 huge sacks full of passports there. They then made a video of his ""happy daily life” before releasing him. His nephew signed a document as his guarantor. When Tursynbek went to see his [recently released] mother-in-law (https://shahit.biz/eng/viewentry.php?entryno=278), there were two people [police and/or civil workers] at her house.<br /><br />He returned to Kazakhstan on February 2, 2019.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Mention in the Globe and Mail (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-i-felt-like-a-slave-inside-chinas-complex-system-of-incarceration/):<br /><br />On Sept. 28, 2017, Chinese state security took Tursynbek Qabi, 45, to the basement of a prison facility and locked him in a cage that was too small for him to lie down. Accused of taking family members to Kazakhstan, he was kept there for six days, sleeping slumped against the bars on the side of the cell. “It was like an animal cage,” he said. Mr. Qabi was then released to a kind of town arrest _ allowed to go home, but not allowed to travel elsewhere without permission. Local officials ordered everyone under the age of 50 to attend nightly Chinese language classes from 6 to 8 p.m., he said.<br /><br />...<br /><br />For others who have left China for Kazakhstan, concern remains for family members still in Xinjiang _ some of whom have made themselves personally liable for those no longer in China. “My relatives signed documents as guarantors, saying when I am in Kazakhstan, I won’t say anything bad about China,” Mr. Qabi said.",,,,,,,,,,35-55,M,Kazakh,outside China,released,July 2017 - Sep. 2017,---,has problems,---

He says that the rules were not very strict, and that they were allowed to converse and move around relatively freely. The study consisted of learning Mandarin and memorizing red songs. He graduated and obtained a diploma.<br /><br />After being released, he was not returned his passport and instead had to make frequent visits to the police station as part of the process to get it back. It was only at the end of July 2017 that the authorities gave him permission to go to Kazakhstan for a month, but only with 4 guarantors – two relatives and two cadres – remaining behind in XJ. He thus spent 27 days in Kazakhstan and then returned to China on August 30, 2017.<br /><br />Upon arriving back in his hometown in XJ, he had all of his documents – including his Chinese ID – confiscated, making it impossible to go anywhere as it is essentially impossible to move around XJ without an ID. He would remain under this sort of town arrest for the coming 6 months, until being put into a “re-education” camp in February 2018.<br /><br />This camp was in the building of the former No. 3 Middle School in Yining County, with the rooms having barred windows and 16 inmates per room. Because of overcrowding, 10 would sleep in the beds and the rest would have to sleep on the floor. Dakei was the only Kazakh in his room – 9 of the others were Hui and 6 were Uyghur.<br /><br />Breakfast in the camp consisted of porridge and a steamed bun. There was no standard toilet in the room – a bucket was used, which they were only allowed to empty once a day. According to Dakei, complaining that the bucket was full and asking to have it emptied resulted in being put into a tiger chair for 14 hours. There were 4 cameras in the room.<br /><br />Though the inmates were originally told that they were there to learn Chinese, the classroom would not be ready until April (two months after the initial internment). However, Dakei was told that he was being transferred to another camp not long before he was scheduled to attend his first Chinese class. Fortunately, this new camp was actually a Party school (__), which also served as a study center for 200 cadres and 27 non-cadres, the latter all being inmates with links to Kazakhstan. The authorities explained this preferential treatment as stemming from China-Kazakhstan friendship. 6 of the 27 were Uyghurs with family in Kazakhstan, while the rest were Kazakh.<br /><br />There, the rooms had TV sets, showers, bathrooms, and phones, and the inmates were completely free apart from not being allowed outside the compound. There was a hospital in the compound as well. Contact with outside China was forbidden, and despite Dakei writing several letters requesting permission to contact his wife in Kazakhstan, he was always refused.<br /><br />Around April 11 or 12, the cadres came and asked everyone if anyone wanted to go to Kazakhstan. The inmates were given 5 minutes to decide. Amazingly, only Dakei said that he did, while everyone else said “no”. Dakei insisted, and after two days would start being invited to “talks“ (__). These went on for a week but didn’t result in any progress, and he would ultimately only be released on October 7, 2018.<br /><br />[At this point, he was supposedly transferred to a factory and stayed there until November 23, 2018 – as reported by the Financial Times in https://www.ft.com/content/eb2239aa-fc4f-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521 – but for some reason he does not mention it here.]  <br /><br />Back in XJ society with his documents still confiscated, he would be allowed to make international phone calls with the permission of the village administration. However, there would always be people accompanying him while he called his wife, with one of the people taking notes. The phone calls lasted only 5 minutes.<br /><br />He was finally able to get his documents and return to Kazakhstan on January 16, 2019.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Mention in the Globe and Mail (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-i-felt-like-a-slave-inside-chinas-complex-system-of-incarceration/):<br /><br />Dakei Zhunishan, 43, also spent six months in a Party school, a place he described as “almost free.” Rooms were equipped with televisions, guards did not require permission to use the toilet and “relatives could come to visit whenever they wanted,” Mr. Zhunishan said. Detainees could not, however, exit the compound without authorization.",,,,,,,,,,35-55,M,Kazakh,outside China,released,Jan. 2018 - Mar. 2018,---,---,---

Also, the police collected blood samples from her and confiscated her passport for a month, after then she went back to Malaysia for the last time.<br /><br />She is also mentioned in the CECC report: https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/CECC%20Pris%20List_20181011_1424.pdf","The testimony has been given three times - twice in video form (in Uyghur and in English) and once in text form (Uyghur) directly to the shahit.biz database. The testifier in all three cases is Gulzire Tashmemet, who now resides in Munich, Germany.",The victim is the testifier's younger sister.,"Gulgine Tashmemet was born on September 17, 1987 in the city of Ghulja (Yining) in Xinjiang's Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. From 2010 to 2017, she studied at the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), obtaining a BS and an MS in computer science. She was set to commence her a doctorate degree there in January 2018. Most of her tuition was paid by her father, but she also taught classes on the weekends as a part-time job.<br /><br />According to information obtained, with the testifier's consent, from a testimony event held in early 2019, Gulgine's address in Ghulja is House 158, 9th Alley, West Xinhua Road.",She is believed to be in Ghulja.,"Gulgine first ran into issues with the authorities when she went back to Ghulja in March 2017 to see her sick father. While there, she was made to sign a statement by the neighborhood police, promising that she would return to China after she finished her classes in Malaysia. She’d lose all connection with her parents if she didn't, and what they said to her was a direct threat: ""If you don’t come back, it will be dangerous for your father."" By that time, her father was already under suspicion because he had previously sent money to Gulzire in Germany. The police also collected Gulgine's blood samples and confiscated her passport for a month, prior to allowing her to return to Malaysia (for what would be her last time).<br /><br />Gulgine's last trip to China was intended as a visit to her family prior to commencing a PhD in Malaysia. She flew there on December 26, 2017 (Kuala Lumpur to Guangzhou to Urumqi). A few days after arriving, she updated her WeChat picture as a sign that she was fine, but a few weeks into January she changed the background to one resembling a prison cell - a wall in a dark room with a shadow of a person. The testifier thus believes that she was detained sometime in January.",Possibly because she had studied abroad.,"A friend confirmed to the testifier that Gulgine had been put into a camp, prior to deleting her on WeChat.",Both through WeChat and through friends/neighbors in Ghulja.,Amnesty International has previously issued an Urgent Action for Gulgine: https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa17/8644/2018/en/<br /><br />Her story is also featured in the UHRP report on disappeared intellectuals: https://docs.uhrp.org/pdf/Detained-and-Disappeared-Intellectuals-Under-Assault-in-the-Uyghur-Homeland.pdf<br /><br />She is also mentioned in the CECC report: https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/CECC%20Pris%20List_20181011_1424.pdf,18-35,F,Uyghur,Ili,concentration camp,Jan. 2018 - Mar. 2018,related to going abroad,---,student

Otherwise, he said, the authorities would have put them in an orphanage. The AP has previously reported that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang.<br /><br />Atta went back to China twice for a few months but both times his visas expired and he had to return to Pakistan.

It is now eight, almost nine months, that I have not seen my children,” he said. “I haven’t even been able to talk to them.”<br /><br />Last week, Atta finally talked to his brother-in-law after a friend discovered he had a heart attack and was recovering in a hospital in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.<br /><br />“He said my sons were good, but he had no news of my wife,” said Atta.""",,,,,,,,,,35-55,F,Uyghur,---,---,July 2017 - Sep. 2017,---,---,---

Gulbahar’s mother has stopped contacting the family in France in May 2018 when she was put under pressure by Chinese police telling her to stop calling abroad.

It has also been supplemented with additional media reports and direct information from the victim's daughter.",No stated relation.,"Gulbahar Haitiwaji is an ethnic Uyghur woman who had been living in France with her husband and two daughters since 2006. She is the only one in the family who has not received French citizenship, but nevertheless holds a 10-year residence permit.","According to her daughter, she is still in Karamay, where she was originally detained.","On November 25, 2016, Gulbahar received a call from her former employer in Xinjiang, asking her to return to China in order to sign pension documents. She was immediately taken into custody upon her arrival at the office in Karamay, with her passport confiscated and with her being forbidden from leaving the region.<br /><br />She was officially arrested on January 29, 2017 at the Karamay airport, as she was returning from Urumqi, after which her family in France would no longer be able to contact Gulbahar directly.<br /><br />A letter from the French Foreign Ministry, which Gulbahar’s family in France received on November 13, 2017, states that Gulbahar was officially arrested on January 29, 2017 and remained in custody until June 5, 2017, when she was released on bail. According to some media sources, she was then put into a “re-education” camp (on June 9, according to one source) for the time of the investigation. It was unclear what kind of investigation was being carried out or how long it would take. It is also very possible that this was not a camp but simply prolonged police custody, perhaps in a different location.<br /><br />On December 27, 2018, Gulbahar's daughter, Gulhumar, publicly posted that the family had learned that her mother had been sentenced to 7 years in prison.<br /><br />In March 2019, Gulhumar suddenly started receiving phone calls from her mother, with the latter telling her that she had been released to house arrest and that Gulhumar should delete all of her public posts about the case if she ""ever wanted to see her alive again"".","According to her daughter Gulhumar, Gulbahar was sentenced to prison for “disturbing public order”. However, it is unclear what formal weight this had, given how she was supposedly released to house arrest just months later.",Now believed to be under some sort of residential surveillance. She has high blood pressure and needs to take medication daily.,"It appears that most of the information that Gulhumar and other family members got they got through the victim's mother, who was allowed to visit the victim once a month. However, Gulbahar’s mother stopped contacting the family in France in May 2018, when she was pressured by the Chinese police to stop calling abroad.<br /><br />The story has also received ample coverage in the press and other public outlets, and much of the information used to write this testimony was taken from there:<br /><br />https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/les-pieds-sur-terre/la-repression-des-ouighours-comment-vivre-sous-lintimidation-chinoise (published 8 OCT 2018)<br />https://www.change.org/p/free-my-mother-from-the-concentration-camp-in-china<br />https://www.boursorama.com/actualite-economique/actualites/comment-ma-mere-a-ete-internee-dans-un-camp-de-reeducation-en-chine-032d16639d3b9684d4909b6c38620439 (published 1 DEC 2018)<br />https://www.lepoint.fr/monde/comment-ma-mere-a-ete-internee-dans-un-camp-de-reeducation-en-chine-30-11-2018-2275592_24.php (published 30 November 2018)<br />http://m.rfi.fr/emission/20190528-chine-ouighours-france-surveillance-totalitaire-harcelements-menaces-disparitions (published 28 MAY 2019)",---,35-55,F,Uyghur,Karamay,house/town arrest,before 2017,disturbing public order,has problems,---

The other, 15 years old, is in the care of the testifier's younger brother. The testifier cannot contact her as she's deleted his WeChat.<br /><br />The testifier's brother had previously done 3 months of camp in 2018 and was released to go work as a bao'an (__), or security officer for 1600RMB/month (though they haven't paid him yet).<br /><br />Testimony 6 (Gulzira's description of her experiences): <br /><br />She spent a year and 7 months in the camp and a factory. She started having medical check-up two days ago (as of January 30, 2019), because she's been having headaches and nausea. The result showed that she has pancreatitis and kidney problems. According to her, the inmates in the camp were given only two minutes for going to the toilet. If you spent more than that, they hit you on the head with an electric baton. They had to study Chinese the whole day, and the inmates were handcuffed when they did something wrong and when they were transferred from one building to the other. They originally stayed in the No. 4 High School in Yining County, then were transferred to another building close to the Yining county's Zhongyi Hospital. In the beginning, the inmates were given books in their languages, but later all these were taken away, leaving only the Chinese-language books. They were required to speak Chinese with each other and to read only in Chinese. There was a ""strange"" policy allowing married inmates to meet their spouses for two hours in a separate room, without interruption. However, the husband had to pay 20 RMB and needed to bring a clean bedsheet with him. The woman had to take a pill before entering the room. When Gulzira was in a factory, they were told that they would be paid according to their efficiency, or ten Chinese cents (_) per pair of gloves produced. The most skilled worker could sew 60 pairs a day, which would total to 6RMB/day. Gulzira tried her best but could only sew 13 pairs. She also mentioned the camps as being split into 4 levels - she was in the lightest.<br /><br />Testimony 7 (Gulzira's description of her experiences): <br /><br />They wore uniforms in camp. When she said she was living in Kazakhstan and her husband and children are in Kazakhstan, the head of the camp told her off, saying they hadn't told her to go there, that she had gone herself and was a Chinese citizen, and should never say ""Kazakhstan"" again. There was a military discipline in the camp. Inmates couldn't cry. If you did you'd be considered to be infected with wrong thoughts and have to sit on a hard chair for 14 hours (7:00-21:00), or you could be transfered to another camp where the rules were even stricter.<br /><br />There was no freedom at all in the camp. They put you in different cells, where the number of inmates varied from 18 to 60. They tried to not let two Kazakhs be in the same cell. So, she usually stayed with Uyghurs and also had to stay with 17 Han, who were detained for their beliefs (possibly, they were Christians or Falungong). When entering the camp, they had to have their hair cut short, in addition to having an anti-flu injection that cost 250RMB. After two months, they also had a blood test, for reasons unknown.<br /><br />Gulzira was supposedly detained because she had visited one of the 26 dangerous countries and had watched foreign movies where people wore hijabs, especially in Turkish TV series. She later found out that she ended up there because the head of the Dadui in her village, Hamit, had signed a contract with the re-education camp that she would be educated from July 18, 2017 to July 18, 2018 and was awarded 5000RMB for his ""contribution"".<br /><br />After being released from the camp she was forcefully sent to a factory. Although they promised to pay 600RMB per month, she only got paid 300RMB upon her release after a month and half. There was Chinese study in both the camp and the factory. ""Workers"" who spoke fluent Chinese were encouraged to go to the factories in inner China, which is where one of her relatives ended up going. The ages of inmates in the camps ranged from 17 to 72. After being in a camp, your ID card would ring whenever you went through metal detectors and they'd take you to the police station to be interrogated, making it impossible to be free after being released from camp because of the omnipresent surveillance.<br /><br />All Kazakhs' passports were taken by the local authorities, and in some villages even the bank cards of retirees have now been confiscated by the local government bodies. You need to go to their office to get your pension, where you tell them your password and they withdraw the money for you without giving you your card. Upon her release from the factory, Gulzira asked the head of the village why they did this. They weren't paid, though they were promised at least 600 RMB or 10 Chinese cents per each pay of gloves they could sew.<br /><br />Gulzira arrived in Kazakhstan on January 5, 2019.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Mention in AFP (https://sg.news.yahoo.com/camps-factories-muslim-detainees-china-using-forced-labour-041047367.html):<br /><br />As Gulzira Auelkhan toiled stitching gloves in a factory in China's troubled Xinjiang region, her managers made no secret of where her production would be sold.<br /><br />""They told us openly that the gloves will be sold abroad, so we should do a good job,"" Auelkhan recalled of a labour stint she says was enforced by Chinese ""re-education"" officials.<br /><br />Auelkhan, a 39-year-old Chinese citizen of Kazakh descent, says she was part of a network of mostly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang who pass from what China calls ""vocational training centres"" to factories where they are forced to work for far less than the local minimum wage.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Auelkhan says she was transferred to the glove factory at the Jiafang industrial estate in Xinjiang's Yining county after spending 15 months in two different ""re-education"" facilities.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Auelkhan has residency rights in Kazakhstan but had travelled to China to see family when she was detained and put into a re-education centre.<br /><br />She said life in the camps was brutal, with residents struck over the head with electrified batons for spending more than two minutes in the bathroom.<br /><br />...<br /><br />So even though they were not free to leave, it was an improvement when she and hundreds of other camp inmates were transferred to work at the factory, Auelkhan told AFP in Kazakhstan's biggest city Almaty.<br /><br />""Every day we were taken to and from a dormitory three kilometres from the factory,"" she said, hugging the five-year-old daughter she didn't see for nearly two years.<br /><br />""When we were studying at the camp they told us we would be taught a trade and work for three months,"" Auelkhan said.<br /><br />Auelkhan said she was paid only 320 yuan ($48/42 euros) for close to two months' work before her time at the factory was curtailed in December and she was allowed to return to her family in Kazakhstan.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Auelkhan believes she was only released from forced labour because of a public campaign launched by her husband and supported by a Xinjiang-focused rights group in Almaty.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Detailed mention in the Globe and Mail (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-i-felt-like-a-slave-inside-chinas-complex-system-of-incarceration/):<br /><br />Before she was shocked with a stun gun to the head for spending more than the allotted two minutes in the toilet, and before she was handcuffed for 24 hours because guards accused her of letting another woman participate in religious washing, and before she was forced to make winter gloves for two pennies a piece _ before all of that, Gulzira Auelhan remembers a Chinese police officer telling her she needed to be educated.<br /><br />The classes would only last 15 days, the officer told her in mid-October, 2017. “You will be released very soon,” Ms. Auelhan, 38, remembers hearing. An ethnic Kazakh who was born in China but had been living in Kazakhstan, she had returned to China’s far western Xinjiang region to visit her father, who was ill.<br /><br />Instead, over the course of 437 days, she was detained in five different facilities, including a factory and a middle school converted into a centre for political indoctrination and technical instruction, with several interludes of a form of house arrest with relatives. The Chinese government has said it offers free vocational education and skills training to people such as Ms. Auelhan. But over more than 14 months, “that training lasted one week,” she said, not including the time she spent forced to work in a factory.<br /><br />The remainder of the time, she spent inside a complex system of incarceration and control that has been built in a region where Chinese authorities say they are combatting extremism through education. Early this year, she was released back to Kazakhstan, where she recounted her experience in a lengthy interview with The Globe and Mail. What she experienced, she said, “is really cruel.”<br /><br />...<br /><br />Ms. Auelhan, like most of the people interviewed for this article, is a Chinese-born ethnic Kazakh, a mother of three who says her main ambition in life has been to raise her children well.<br /><br />She moved to Kazakhstan in 2014, but returned to China for a visit on Oct. 16, 2017. Chinese border officials seized her passport and ordered her to wait until the arrival of police, who escorted her to her hometown in Duolang Village.<br /><br />They told Ms. Auelhan she could not go to see her father.<br /><br />Instead, they told her she needed to get some schooling. She offered to pack her clothes and collect some money for expenses. No need, they replied. Everything would be free of charge. She was confused. “I said, ‘Okay, what kind of place is it, if you don’t even need to spend money or wear clothes?’ ”<br /><br />...<br /><br />Ms. Auelhan discovered what kind of place she was being taken to almost as soon as she arrived. The sign read “Yining County Vocational School,” but it was surrounded by high walls and guard towers. It was ”completely like a prison,” she said. Inside, staff ordered her to change into a uniform _ red shirt, black track pants _ and cut short her hair, saying it was for hygienic purposes. They locked her in a cell with 32 other women, each with their own bunk bed.<br /><br />It was the first of four centres where she would be incarcerated over the following year _ her own personal journey through the complex assemblage of internment in Xinjiang. She stayed at a converted hospital, a middle school and a new mid-rise facility that seemed purpose-built for what China calls vocational training.<br /><br />“They told us, ‘You are here to be educated because you were infected with evil thoughts of religion,’ ” she recalled.<br /><br />Soon after arriving at the first centre, Ms. Auelhan began to learn the rules of her new life. Each night, she and the others took two-hour shifts to watch each other. “Even if you wanted to kill yourself, there was no possibility, because you are being monitored everywhere,” she said.<br /><br />“We couldn’t even cry because if you cry, they say you have evil thoughts in your mind.”<br /><br />Trips to the toilet had to be done in pairs, so one woman could keep an eye on the other, in part to prevent forbidden religious expression, including ablution. Once, Ms. Auelhan accompanied to the toilet an older lady who accidentally splashed urine on her own feet. When guards noticed that the woman had rinsed herself clean, they saw it as ritual washing, and punished Ms. Auelhan by handcuffing her hands behind her back for 24 hours.<br /><br />In April, 2018, she said, prison staff brought out buckets of prayer mats and ordered the detainees to set them on fire.<br /><br />China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to detailed questions sent about her account.<br /><br />But for Ms. Auelhan, who calls herself Muslim but does not pray, one of the chief hardships was use of the toilet, because women were restricted to two minutes each time. Detainees frequently experienced constipation _ she’s not certain whether it was the infrequency of bathroom access or the daily diet of steamed buns, rice, potatoes and maize. But if they spent more than 120 seconds on the toilet, “you can expect you will be electric shocked,” she said. Stun guns would typically be applied to the head. “They explained that if they did it on the body, it might leave a mark,” Ms. Auelhan said.<br /><br />Guards told detainees that they were “under military discipline,” with cameras constantly watching _ including in bathrooms and during weekly showers. Even so, monthly conjugal visits were allowed, she said, for a fee of $4; another detainee confirmed the existence of such visits.<br /><br />Yet such allowances were a rare break from days filled with Chinese language classes and lectures on health, politics and law. Instructors regularly ordered the writing of confession letters, which included thanks “to the Communist Party for the education it provided,” and for “giving us this opportunity to clear our evil thoughts.”<br /><br />Ms. Auelhan found herself experiencing flashes of agreement, reflecting as she wrote on the happiness she had felt growing up in Xinjiang.<br /><br />But the feeling did not last, because “everything else they did to us was a complete lie,” she said. That extended to appearance: When her hair began to go grey, she was given dye to make it black when dignitaries visited, and told to smile.<br /><br />But Ms. Auelhan could not stop thinking about the gap between what she was being told and what she saw unfolding around her. “They say all of the ethnic groups in China are together in peace and love,” she said. Why, then, she wondered, were Muslims virtually the only ones in detention?<br /><br />In nearly a year spent in various indoctrination centres, she received a single week of instruction on a sewing machine, before being released Oct. 7, 2018.<br /><br />But she was not yet free. Instead, after a week spent with family, the next chapter of her detention was about to begin, in a factory. The indoctrination wasn’t over, either.<br /><br />In late November of 2018, the village secretary in Ms. Auelhan’s hometown arrived with a document. It said she needed to report for work to a glove-making factory. “You need money,” the official told her.<br /><br />At the factory, her superiors told her the gloves, whose brands she could not recall, would be sold abroad, “so we needed to try our best,” she said. She was taken to work at the Yining County Home Textile and Clothing Industrial Park where, according to a government website, the Yili Zhuowan Clothing Manufacturing Co. produces US$15-million a year in gloves for export to the United States, Russia, the European Union and Japan. A person who answered a phone at the company said he knew nothing about its hiring practices.<br /><br />Ms. Auelhan was promised pay of $119 a month, in a region where the local minimum wage is $290, until the factory’s owners, citing the cost of feeding her and ferrying her home for weekly Sunday family visits, switched to a piecemeal system, paying two cents a completed pair. On her best day, she completed 11 pairs.<br /><br />While at the factory, Ms. Auelhan lived in a dormitory roughly three kilometres away, where she could leave her room but not the compound. Here, too, education continued. Workers received readings in the factory before work and, at day’s end, 45-minute Chinese lessons in the dormitory, where they were watched at night by an official.<br /><br />Then, on Dec. 29, police took her for interrogation and held her overnight in a dark room. The next day, officials bought her a lunch of besbarmak, a Kazakh dish with horse meat and noodles. “They told me, ‘You must miss meat,’” she said. After lunch, they released her to her father’s house. She was paid $45.50 for her factory labours.<br /><br />On Jan. 5, officials escorted her to the Kazakhstan border. “Remember that you are not allowed to say anything about the camps or what you have been through while you were in China,” she recalled them saying.<br /><br />“If you do, then remember that it’s very easy for the Chinese government to find you.”<br /><br />...<br /><br />Ms. Auelhan’s family has also struggled. She has a daughter still in Xinjiang, while in Kazakhstan, her husband struggles to believe that she vanished into detention centres for so long. He “is very good to me,” she said.<br /><br />“But sometimes he asks, ‘Did you really spend that time there? You weren’t with another man?’ ”",,,,,,,,,,35-55,F,Kazakh,outside China,released,---,related to going abroad,has problems,---

We had to watch it,” Ms. Senbai said. Later, at the indoctrination centre, instructors asked us, ’Why do you believe in God? Do you think that if you need money and you pray, that God will give you money? You should think logically,’ ” Ms. Senbai recalled.<br /><br />...<br /><br />In nearly a year of detention, Ms. Senbai spent 45 days studying hairdressing.<br /><br />“But in fact we didn’t learn anything,” she said. “For example, I didn’t learn how to cut hair.” Daily lessons consisted of two hours of theoretical instruction. Students were then given books to study.

She is married to Uali Islam, with whom she has a son and a daughter, the latter three all having immigrated to Kazakhstan in 2016 and received citizenship, with only Sairagul staying behind in Xinjiang.<br /><br />A communist party member, she worked as a kindergarten director from 2016 on, prior to being drafted to serve as a teacher in a ""re-education camp"" in late 2017. In April 2018, she learned that she herself could be detained soon and escaped China, leaving behind property and buying fake documents to get out of China through the Korgas boundary-cooperation zone, where she was allegedly able to take advantage of the chaos on the Kazakh side to slip past the Kazakh customs and to illegally enter Kazakhstan. She went unbothered for a month, prior to being arrested by Kazakh security services on May 21, 2018.<br /><br />After some time in detention, she was put on trial for illegally crossing the border - a trial that would consist of four sessions, held on July 9, July 14, July 23, and August 1. The case drew international attention given her ""ex-camp instructor"" identity and as many believed Sairagul's fate and life to be on the line, with a negative verdict potentially resulting in her being deported back to China. The resonance of the case increased when she announced, during the second session, that she had worked in a so-called ""re-education camp"", that it was actually just ""a prison in the mountains"", that there were 2500 Kazakhs in that camp alone, and that she knew of two others like it. To the best of my knowledge, this was the first time that the existence of the camps and their nature were testified to in a court of law. On August 1, 2018, she was given a positive verdict - a 6-month suspended sentence - allowing her to be reunited with her family and to stay in Kazakhstan.<br /><br />Within a day, she received news that her relatives in Xinjiang were detained. Another day or two later, she was effectively ""quarantined"" by her lawyer Abzal Kuspan, with the help of media assistant Saule Abedinova, who publicly stated that Sairagul should not talk publicly about the camps or see anyone (outside her immediate family), as these actions could result in her hasty deportation to China - since she was applying for asylum status and was at risk until she got it. This ""quarantine"" ended partially a month later, as Sairagul was able to appear in public again (it was during this time that I met her while she and local activists from the rights group Atajurt were in front of the German embassy inquiring about her possibilities of asylum abroad). However, to the present day she has been unable to talk in detail about the camps, citing threats and pressure.<br /><br />In applying for asylum status, she has been refused the status twice, prompting her to part ways with both Kuspan and Abedinova (accusing the latter of blocking access both to Kuspan and to media),  to hire Aiman Umarova as her lawyer, and to sue the asylum committee for refusing her the status. This second trial started in February 2019.","She and her family reside in Esik, a town close to Almaty, Kazakhstan.","It is difficult to define detention in this case, but it may be said that she was &quot;detained&quot; in late 2017, when she was forced to leave her position at the kindergarten and to go instruct at the camp.",I believe that she stated that she was obliged to go teach at the camp as her position at the kindergarten was a government job and necessitated her complying with the transfer.,"She is currently in Kazakhstan, suing the asylum committee, without any legal status (apart from refugee-seeker documents).

On 26 March, he went to Turpan to visit his mother when he was taken away by 5 policemen to a police station. Omir was told that he was a suspect and accused of having invited Chinese people to Kazakhstan, helping them with paperwork which translated into accusations against him of insitgating terrorism, organising terror activities and covering up for terrorists. He was also told that there was a warrant for his arrest from Karamay City Public Security Bureau (Omir had lived in Karamay 10 years ago), even though the police station in Turpan never showed any evidence to Omir that this warrant really existed. Before sending him to prison (source: RFA) / local police station (source: living otherwise) in Turpan where he remained for eight days, he was handcuffed and a black hood was placed<br />over his head and he was taken to a hospital in Pichan where he had his blood taken and was given a full body examination, without his hood ever being removed. On his first day in prison/the local police station in Pichan, he was interrogated by three men (one Uyghur and two Chinese) who had come from Karamay. <br />They accused him again of having helped people with their visa applications and having taken money from them claiming that he could obtain passports for them. On 3 April 2017, he was taken in handcuffs and shackles to Jarenbulaq (Chin: Baijiantan) district police station in Karamay. Here again, he was accused of having helped Chinese Muslims to leave China via Karamay to Turkey, Syria and Europe. He was tortured to admit the allegations against him.<br /><br />On 17 April, he was taken to the Karamay City Prison where he remained shackled and/or chained for the entire stay. He was interrogated two more times (10 July and in September). He was visited by officials from the Kazakh embassy on 16 or 17 July. <br />On 4 November 2017, he signed papers admitting his guilt and was released from prison and taken to a policial re-education camp. However, the staff working at the camp did not admit him, because his medical record said that he suffered from hypertension, so the police took him to a hospital and had his medical records updated after which he was admitted to the camp.<br />In the camp, he was expected to sing songs to praise the Communist Party, learn about the dangers of religion and Islam, present self-criticism in front of other inmates and learn about history and learn the Chinese language. He was not allowed to go into the courtyard anymore after refusing to speak Chinese and later placed in solidary confinement.<br />He was released on 24 November 2017 with the help of the Kazakh government. He received a 15-days visa and returned to Kazakhstan on 4 December 2017.<br /><br />The only written proof of his detention in China is a handwritten note by a Chinese police department stating that he was held on suspicion of endangering national security<br />and that he has been released without charge.",,,,,,,,,,35-55,M,Uyghur,outside China,released,Jan. 2017 - Mar. 2017,terrorism,---,private business

3637,Abduhelil Ablahat,654101198505291994,"My name is Mansur Hasanoff, I am an Australian citizen currently living in Adelaide, Australia. I work as an accountant here in Adelaide.",I am the brother in law to the victim and my wife Nafisa Hasanoff is the older sister to the victim. I am testifying on behalf of my wife Nafisa Hasanoff.,"Abduhelil Ablahat (Abuduheilili Abulaihaiti) is a business man with various business interests. Born 29th May 1985 and raised in Ghulja in East Turkistan he is the youngest sibling in his family. <br /><br />A favourite among the household known for his great personality, humour and wit, he is extremely talented and intelligent. Being the youngest in the family he is probably the most loved as he is extremely close with his parents and other members of his family.<br /><br />Abduhelil comes from a very close knit family and he is also the care taker to his ill mother and takes care of most of the family’s needs as both parents are quite old and frail. He is often sought after by all other members of the family and extended family for any issues they need help with. Being extremely well connected with many friends and acquaintances he is known to be extremely helpful. Abduhelil has a natural talent for being personable and making friends and is very well known among other Uyghurs within the city of Ghulja.<br /><br />Along with being a very close family, they also have an extremely large extended family who all are extremely fond of Abduhelil. He is considered one of the most popular individuals among all the numerous relatives.<br /><br />Abduhelil was married and has one son named Atabik born 18th March 2017 during his incarceration in the concentration camp. Currently in a concentration camp with his whereabouts unknown.","Assumed to be in Ghulja, but whereabouts unknown.",Arrested on 18th August 2016 and put in prison for three months. Arrested again in February 2017 for no reason and in June 2017 the family was first made aware he had been sent to a concentration camp.,Detailed below.,"Saturday 13th April 2019: we were made aware via a social media post by Abduhelil’s older sister that he had arrived home. She had posted pictures of Abduhelil hugging his mother. Prior to this information no one in the family knew anything about Abduhelil’s whereabouts or whether he was alive or dead.<br /><br />My wife has been unable to speak with any of her sisters for more than two years now and has had intermittent communication with her frail old mother. However recently they have been barred from having direct communication and the mother is only able to send messages sometimes only once in a three month period. They cannot communicate freely and my wife received a message two days ago from the mother, however the mother did no mention Abduhelil and when my wife cryptically tried to refer to him, she did not respond.<br /><br />Upon seeing the pictures my wife burst into tears. I saw the pictures and was speechless, Abduhelil looked extremely frail & skinny, from the photos I assume he has lost over half his body weight and is extremely pale. Looking like an old frail man compared to how he was when we spent time together in 2016, my memories of him were how lively he was, constantly laughing and playing. Seeing his photos and his condition now has made our blood boil at the travesty and injustice of this. How any government on earth can treat their own citizens so inhumanely is unspeakable. He has come home to greet his mother looking just as concentration camp survivors did leaving the concentration camps of the Nazi’s.<br /><br />He was in perfect health prior to being incarcerated and we would often play soccer together during my trip and often hike up in the mountains for hours on end. During his incarceration we were aware of his very poor health and now looking at the photo’s we are even more extremely concerned for his health and wellbeing. We have no information for why he was able to visit his mother nor what timeframes this is for. Even if released the government has absolute impunity and can come to house and arrest him with no justification at their whim. There is absolutely no guarantee of security and we have also heard that people who come out of these camps are being used as forced labour. Seeing his condition now we believe if he were to be put back into these camps he would most certainly die from the inhumane conditions and neglect. He has quite literally been rotting in these camps having now seen his photo. <br /><br />Due to the above and seeing his condition now, no words can describe the worry we have for his health and future.","I visited East Turkistan from 3rd July 2016 to 22ndAugust 2016 along with my wife and two children. My wife stayed an extra month longer however I had to return due to work commitments. During the later part of my trip, my wife and I travelled around East Turkistan visiting Turpan, Korla &amp; Kashgar, staying in each city for a few days. Once we arrived in Kashgar my wife told me she was extremely concerned about Abduhilil as he had not contacted her in a couple days, this being extremely out of the norm. I told my wife not to worry as I thought nothing could happen to him as he is an upstanding citizen having had no criminal past and has always behaved in an exemplary way.<br /><br />My wife is extremely close to Abduhelil having spent their childhood together and being born roughly one year apart. During our stay Abduhelil being very sociable would speak to us daily. Upon our arrival back to Ghulja we were made aware that he was detained. At the time Abduhilil was in hospital taking care of his mother who is frail and suffers from arthritis and other conditions. A number of police took him away from the hospital without saying a thing. His whereabouts was unknown to his entire family during this period.<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to leave to Australia a few days later, but during this time his wife and all family members were extremely distraught not knowing anything about his condition or why he was detained. My wife remained by the family for another month before returning to Australia as well.","Since they were unable to travel the Mother’s health deteriorated rapidly and Abduhelil was first arrested in hospital while looking after his mother.<br /><br />Upon his first arrest his wife was pregnant with their first son, he wasn’t allowed to see his new born son and he obtained terrible infections whilst incarcerated due the extremely poor conditions he faced. These infections and his health deteriorated so badly that under police control he was released for a two month period to gain medical treatment. He was incarcerated again in October 2017 and his whereabouts was not known again, nor whether he was dead or alive.<br /><br />Aside from having his own life destroyed and good health compromised this has taken an extremely large mental toll on all family members. Non of them knowing whether their beloved brother is alive and well. My wife being best of friends and growing up together with such fond memories of her little brother has had an extremely hard time coping with this. During my trip to East Turkistan I spent everyday with Abduhelil having travelled with him to Urumqi and other parts of Ghulja almost daily, seeing how the family has been affected by this injustice and having so many fond memories of our time together has caused intense pain for me aswell.<br /><br />Abduhelil is a beloved individual who is exemplary in every way, being a law abiding citizen. His innocence has been taken away with no legal oversight and no information. He has been thrown in these camps with the key being thrown away. Never allowed to communicate with his son or his family. His health has deteriorated rapidly and no medical help has ever been given to him by the authorities. This is a travesty, inhumane in its extreme and as such we are testifying on his behalf to bring awareness to this and to end this injustice he is facing.",,,,,,,,,,18-35,M,Uzbek,Ili,---,before 2017,---,has problems,private business

His last WeChat post advertises his having obtained first editions of “Iz” and &quot;Oyghanghan Zemin&quot;, historical novels that - I think - were already banned by then.

The family was then held in detention for 32 days and questioned by authorities from Xinjiang.

4697,Ezmet Abley,654101198605082217,"My name is Dana Hasan, I am an Australian citizen currently living in Melbourne, Australia.",I am the victims fiancée.,"Azmat Ablay (Aizimaiti Abulai), born 8th May 1986 (33 years old), Uyghur, lives in Ghulja.<br /><br />Azmat is regarded as a kind, well-mannered and sociable young man. He has sole custody of his two young children from a previous marriage. His sons Muhammat, 7 and Mustafa, 6 are inquisitive and delightful children. From the time they were toddlers, Azmat played the role of both mother and father. The way he was with his children garnered my admiration and respect. From feeding and clothing his children, to changing their nappies, to dealing with any sickness, he was a very hands-on father. Despite the unfortunate circumstances he found himself in, he took it upon himself to raise happy and well-mannered children by instilling good values and morals. Despite the many trials in his life he always remained positive and hopeful. <br /><br />What struck me was how much his sons adored him. His younger son Mustafa would cry during the night when he realized his father wasn’t sleeping beside him and I can’t help but think of those tears knowing their father is in a concentration camp. I still recall the children’s laughter as they played with their father. No matter what, even if there were dozens of chores and matters that needed attending to, Azmat would always make sure to put aside time to just be present and focus all his attention on them, without distraction.<br /><br />The rare times Muhammat and Mustafa were at their birth mothers residence, they would insist on going back home and beg for their father to return, which would result in their stay being cut short.  After these visits, Azmat would have to spend the whole night taking care of them, as their young bodies expelled all the artificial sugar they consumed during their short stay. Sweets were often used to placate them when crying and due to the lack of proper supervision, there was no one to curb their consumption of these foods.<br /><br />Azmat felt strongly about the health of his children, he would always make sure that his sons ate nutritiously and moderately. He would cook them wholesome Uyghur dishes. Treats were given sporadically and within reason. He was consistent and rational in his approach to parenting and firm in his ideas of how children ought to be raised.<br /><br />To the Chinese authorities, he is just a name or a number to reach their quota of detainees. To his children, not only is he their father, but a friend, a protector, a way to a better future. These early years are crucial to children’s development and without a strong parental figure, this may prove detrimental to the children’s growth. This cruel government cares not for the psychological, mental or physical effects Muhammat and Mustafa are enduring in the absence of their father. Despite everything, I hope they will grow to become men he will be proud of and I hope they share his qualities whether it is his kind heart, his strong faith or his humanity.<br /><br />For years, Azmat was also the primary carer to his ailing father who had a heart condition. Ablay was a gentle and soft-spoken man in his 70s. He relied heavily on his son and often sought his son’s advice on matters. It was obvious the trust and love between them, had passed on to Azmat’s relationship with his own sons. <br /><br />When Azmat got word of his impending visit to the ‘’school”, his father was very ill. Azmat feared that his father’s condition would further deteriorate after hearing the news, so he informed his father it would only be for a few weeks at most, in order to protect him from the brutal truth, that he may never see his son again. Those weeks stretched to months until Ablay’s death. <br /><br />His father passed away in December 2017, whilst Azmat was in the concentration camp. Azmat was released for a period of 3 days to attend his father’s funeral. Few years prior, his mother had passed away due to a brain tumour, Azmat was now left with only his older brother and younger sister.<br /><br />In October 2017, the authorities detained Azmat. At the time, he was just like any other young man, doing his best to raise his family. He had not broken any laws nor committed any crimes. Azmat was a law-abiding citizen. Few days prior, he was made aware that he would inevitably be detained due to the quota the authorities set for that area. He happened to fit their bill of being Uyghur, male and within the target age range.<br /><br />Months before he disappeared into the abyss, I recall when Azmat and his friend picked me up to attend a dinner and I noticed traditional Uyghur boots and costumes strewn across the back seat. I was told they had just come back from a performance, which I found perplexing. They were not the type to partake in the arts. Turned out the local authorities were forcing them to don these costumes to dance for the mainly Han tourists. That’s what the Uyghur people had become to the Chinese, a cultural gimmick to indulge the clueless tourists.<br /><br />Those that are in these concentration camps may have it the worst, but that’s not the say those outside, apparently moving about freely aren’t suffering either, especially having to pander to the communist government’s ridiculous demands.<br /><br />Currently, Azmat’s exact whereabouts are unknown.<br /><br />[additional from testifier: Azmat had a small business selling herbal medicines.

Oreyetgul and the family flew to Beijing twice; the second time on May 26, 2019, to hand in the last documents. In the hotel, the police broke their door, interrogated them and asked them to go back to Urumqi immediately. The next day, Belgian embassy officials informed Oreyetgul that the application could take up to three months to process, which prompted her to refuse to leave the embassy grounds on suspicion that she might get detained. The security forced them out into the yard, where they stayed until 2AM in the night when the embassy called the Chinese police and asked to remove the family.

Five days later, two officials came to her family's house and asked her mother and father whether Aytursun had been medically unfit before. After the family asked whether she had fallen ill, they were taken to Kashgar's Yuandong hospital, where the doctors told Aytursun's mother Patigul that her daughter had died and that they were going to perform an autopsy.

She was only able to see Aytursun's face before being taken away from the room. Yasin said the authorities claimed her daughter had a medical condition, and because she was so weak, she was “unable to cope with being questioned.” After signing some documents, Patigul received Aytursun's death certificate which said that her daughter had been ""an uneducated farmer"" who had been suffering from four different heart conditions, including arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy.<br />Aytursun's body was taken to her home, but her family was not allowed to see her or even attend the burial, which was supervised by several officials in secrecy.
